## 01 Background and Motivation

### Outdoor air pollution

- Reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are key tasks for China.
- Air pollutants and GHGs: not evenly distributed, and diversified with heights.
- China: more high-rise buildings in cities.
- References: Apte et al. ES&T. (2017), Stuz et al., JGR. (2004).

### Value we can bring:

## 02 Objective and Cooperation

### Objective 1: Ambient AQ and GHG emission sensor package

- Sensor Package for Ambient Air Quality.
- Integration.

### Objective 2: Satellite-Sky-Ground GHG Monitoring System

- Establish a satellite-sky-ground GHG monitoring system.

### Objective 3: Analyzing the chemical and physical properties of airborne matter

### Objective 1: Ambient AQ and GHG emission sensor package

- A platform for 3D air quality and GHG measurement.

### Objective 2: Satellite-Sky-Ground GHG Monitoring System

- Satellite Monitoring: Captures satellite data across extensive geographical areas.
- Drone Measurement: Provides detailed examination and targeted local analysis in identified area (including flux measurement).
- Ground Station Analysis: Verifies and calibrates data from satellites and drones, integrating data sources.

### Objective 2: Satellite-Sky-Ground GHG Monitoring System

- Prediction of air quality with high spatial resolution.
- From satellite to the ground.
- From now to future.
- From ground stations to blank spot.
- Generating high-quality data that can use for decision and policy making.

### Objective 3: To analyze the chemical and physical properties of airborne matter

- Sample collection: Use drone-mounted samplers to collect PM and VOCs.
- Analyze samples: Examine chemical compositions, physical properties, oxidative potential, and vertical distribution.
- Comprehensive analysis: Reveal chemical processes of air airborne particles, pollution transport, and long-range health impacts.

## 03 Progress and Planning

### Completion of data collection and iteration

- Prototype
- Post-processing

### Phase 1 - Phase 4

- 3/2025
- 3/2026
- 7/2026
- 10/2025

### Progress

- Prototype for Prediction Model using satellites.
- Prototype for Sensors.

#### Collaboration

- Group meetings for seven times with three PhD students, four professors, another MPhil student, and one postdoc.
- Incorporating valuable advice from peers, including roommates, online voices, and document survey.
- Prototype for Prediction Model combining AI and numerical simulation.

### Utilizing the following equipment and facilities on HKUST-GZ campus

- Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) at SAERF to measure the VOCs.
- Vocus-CIMS to analyze offline VOC and PM samples, but heavy for airborne measurement.
- Environmental simulation chamber to simulate environmental conditions for sensor testing.
- Plate reader at Bio-CRF for analyzing cell toxicity.

### Other equipment, materials, and supplies need to be purchased

- Chemical materials for offline analysis of VOCs and particles.
- A 3-D anemometer that can measure wind speed at a frequency high enough for eddy covariance measurements.
- Drone that can carry enough payload.
- LI7500DS fast-response CO2 analyzer for eddy covariance measurement.
- A Vocus-Elf for real-time measurement of VOCs in human-carrying eVTOLs.
