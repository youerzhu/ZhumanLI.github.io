## 01 Background and Motivation

### Outdoor air pollution

- Reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are key tasks for China.
- Air pollutants and GHGs: not evenly distributed, and diversified with heights.
- China: more high-rise buildings in cities.

### Value we can bring:
* Innovation in Technology and Methodology
  * Foundation for the scientific research of air quality
  * Improving understanding of the spatial distribution of air pollutants and their potential causes
* Support Environmental Research and Policy
  * Provide valuable data for researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders to make informed decisions and implement effective strategies
* Public Health and Environmental Safety
  * Ensuring a safe and healthy environment
  * Provide safer air for passengers and pilots of eVTOLs
* Application Prospects
  * Feasible for practical applicationshht
  * Broad application prospects for related equipment

- Satellite Monitoring: Captures satellite data across extensive geographical areas.
- Drone Measurement: Provides detailed examination and targeted local analysis in identified area (including flux measurement).
- Ground Station Analysis: Verifies and calibrates data from satellites and drones, integrating data sources.
- Prediction of air quality with high spatial resolution.
  - From satellite to the ground.
  - From now to future.
  - From ground stations to blank spot.
- Generating high-quality data that can use for decision and policy making.

#### Objective 3: Analyzing the chemical and physical properties of airborne matter

- Sample collection: Use drone-mounted samplers to collect PM and VOCs.
- Analyze samples: Examine chemical compositions, physical properties, oxidative potential, and vertical distribution.
- Comprehensive analysis: Reveal chemical processes of air airborne particles, pollution transport, and long-range health impacts.

### Collaboration

- Group meetings for seven times with three PhD students, four professors, another MPhil student, and one postdoc.
- Incorporating valuable advice from peers, including roommates, online voices and document survey.

### Resources Identification

#### Utilizing the following equipment and facilities on HKUST-GZ campus

- Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) at SAERF to measure the VOCs.

<img src="../../images/G.png" width=30%>
- Vocus-CIMS to analyze offline VOC and PM samples, but heavy for airborne measurement.

<img src="../../images/v.png" width=30%>
- Environmental simulation chamber to simulate environmental conditions for sensor testing.

<img src="../../images/E.png" width=30%>

- Plate reader at Bio-CRF for analyzing cell toxicity.

<img src="../../images/P.png" width=30%>

#### Other equipment, materials, and supplies need to be purchased

- Chemical materials for offline analysis of VOCs and particles.
- A 3-D anemometer that can measure wind speed at a frequency high enough for eddy covariance measurements.
- Drone that can carry enough payload.

<img src="../../images/dronr.png" width=30%>

- LI7500DS fast-response CO2 analyzer for eddy covariance measurement.
- A Vocus-Elf for real-time measurement of VOCs in human-carrying eVTOLs.
