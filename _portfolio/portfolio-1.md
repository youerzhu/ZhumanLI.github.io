## 01 Background and Motivation

### Outdoor air pollution

- Reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are key tasks for China.
- Air pollutants and GHGs: not evenly distributed, and diversified with heights.
- China: more high-rise buildings in cities.

### Value we can bring:
* Innovation in Technology and Methodology
  * Foundation for the scientific research of air quality
  * Improving understanding of the spatial distribution of air pollutants and their potential causes
* Support Environmental Research and Policy
  * Provide valuable data for researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders to make informed decisions and implement effective strategies
* Public Health and Environmental Safety
  * Ensuring a safe and healthy environment
  * Provide safer air for passengers and pilots of eVTOLs
* Application Prospects
  * Feasible for practical applications
  * Broad application prospects for related equipment
